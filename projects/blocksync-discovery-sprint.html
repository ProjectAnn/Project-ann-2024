A dynamic, cross-functional approach designed to foster collaboration, rapid iteration and efficient learning. In this particular instance, we tailored the sprint to a half-sprint as we were leveraging existing resource reporting efforts. This discovery was the first step to take <span>BlockSync from a data management platform to a analytics platform.</span><br></p>

After introducing discovery sprints, resource reporting fundamentals and key personas we engaged subject matter experts to gain further insights into the problem. During these discussions, we crafted &#x27;How might we&#x27; statements, with the decision maker carefully selecting them to identify our core goals summarized as: <br><br>&quot;<strong><em>Enabling effortless, shareable block model comparisons across various customer roles while ensuring clarity and efficiency. &quot;<br><br>‍</em></strong>To validate these statements, we conducted a comprehensive review of wireframes for resource reporting, identifying gaps in our journey. We determined that a critical task was <strong>comparing reports</strong>, prompting us to explore existing solutions both within and beyond the mining industry. Our day finished with a individual exercise where we sketched solutions for the problem customers have comparing reports, manifesting our ideas visually to refine and show the following day. As a result we achieved alignment, a shared context, and a deep understanding of the customer problem.<br></p>

      <p class="paragraph-14">The second days objective was to refine the journey and flow that we intended to test. We presented and discussed everyone&#x27;s sketches, creating a heat map to highlight intriguing aspects. We drafted a flowchart, and aligned it with the hypotheses we intended to test. Would the automatic generation of reports for each block model be valuable or considered as spam? We also considered the users ability to select a specific block model for reporting and their ease in finding past reports or accessing a list of reports. We further deconstructed the flowchart to storyboard our wireframes. </p>

      <p class="paragraph-12">We approached the day with a division of responsibilities, effectively distributing the work among team members. Each member had a primary role: interviewing, scripting, stitching, and drawing. We conducted a dry run, inviting a team member who was not directly involved in the sprint to provide fresh perspectives on the prototype. This exercise aimed to identify any potential refinements before presenting the prototypes to our customers and internal participants. Following this external review, we made subtle adjustments to ensure that the prototypes were in optimal shape for customer evaluation.<br></p><img src="../images/Blocksprintprototype.PNG" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Blocksprintprototype-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Blocksprintprototype-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Blocksprintprototype-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Blocksprintprototype.PNG 1399w" alt="">

      <p class="paragraph-14">We conducted one-hour meetings with the participants. These sessions started with an introduction to discovery sprints, our sprint goal followed by participants briefly talking about their roles and experiences. We provided them with a clickable prototype for interactive exploration, during which we identified successful components and areas of confusion, along with questions and ideas for the future.<br><br>Participants expressed enthusiasm for the comparison features, sparking discussions around pain points, scenarios, and use cases. All participants stressed the importance of including percentage differences alongside raw numbers in the comparison screen, as it enables them to be more agile and responsive in their processes, contrasting with their previously rigid and time-consuming approach. The automatic report creation upon block model changes was well-received for streamlining the process, with customers mentioning the importance of consistency and the challenges of frequent model updates.<strong><br><br></strong><em>&quot;Those comparisons that we do is by creating shapes and then we will do like a resource report, export that out into Excel and then do comparisons that way… Then we&#x27;ll go back to previous version. So that&#x27;s probably the clunkiest part of the workflow, is when you want to see the impact of whether you&#x27;re where the grade has changed within your model...&quot;</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>- </em><strong><em>Participant, Superintendent Mine Geologist</em></strong><strong>‍</strong>‍</p><img src="../images/Frame-34.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Frame-34-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Frame-34-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Frame-34-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Frame-34-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/Frame-34.png 1601w" alt="">

Matthew, a Lead Software Developer, expressed his enthusiasm, stating <strong><em>&quot;This was the first time the team had engaged in a UX design activity like this, and it was just so well organized. The outcomes were amazing, and the team got so much out of it - I&#x27;m looking forward to having an opportunity to run another one.&quot;</em></strong><em><br></em><br>I discovered the crucial role of adaptability in facilitating our process - adjusting activities on the fly became essential, as there were more vital questions and discussions than I expected between scheduled activities. This provided participants with opportunities to dive into the material, creating a rich learning environment.</p>
